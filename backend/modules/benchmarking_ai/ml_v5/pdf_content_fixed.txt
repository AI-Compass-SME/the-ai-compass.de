Code of Conduct
We expect all participants to our events and community to abide to this code of conduct: 
LadyNerds Code of Conduct (http://bit.ly/LadyNerds-CoC).
We follow the LadyNerds Code of Conduct because we are dedicated to providing a safe, inclusive, 
welcoming, and harassment-free space and experience for all members and guests, regardless of gender 
identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, socioeconomic status, body 
size, ethnicity, nationality, level of experience, age, or religion (or lack thereof). 
The Code of Conduct exists because of that dedication. We do not tolerate harassment in any form and we 
prioritise marginalised peopleʼs safety over privileged peopleʼs comfort.
